    title: "Direct progression on selection",
    rationale: "I removed the traditional “Next” button and used card selection to automatically advance the user, reducing friction and keeping the flow fast and intuitive."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Step-by-step guided flow",
    rationale: "The experience is divided into clear stages (style, color, materials, furniture), helping users focus on one decision at a time and reducing cognitive load."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Layered progress feedback",
    rationale: "The interface combines a step-based progress indicator (process level) with in-step dot indicators (content level), providing orientation at both macro and micro levels."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "Consistent interaction pattern",
    rationale: "Sliders and card-based selection are reused across all steps to improve learnability and reduce decision effort."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "Review before final output",
    rationale: "A summary step allows users to review their selections and jump back to any step to make adjustments without restarting the entire flow, supporting visual comparison and iteration."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: "Reset and iteration",
    rationale: " A “New moodboard” action clears the state and allows users to quickly start over, supporting exploration and experimentation."
